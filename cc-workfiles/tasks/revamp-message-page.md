Please design a detailed plan to visual refactor the src/web/chat/components/MessageList. I have provided a screenshot of ideal message page in the cc-workfiles/knowledge/ui/message-page.html and cc-workfiles/knowledge/ui/message-page.png.

You need to first describe the image and the html design in detail especially the position, size and style of each element, and study current implementation in src/web/chat/components/MessageList.tsx.

You should copy the html design and implement it in src/web/chat/components/MessageList.tsx. You should:

- render the assistant tool call in the same visual as the "Analyzed" cell in the example, showing all raw calling and results in a code area.
- render the assistant text message, user text message and input area exactly as the example.

Present the plan to me first.
